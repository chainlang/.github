# 🔗 Chainlang

**Chainlang** is an experimental, open-source programming language designed to make smart contracts truly **cross-chain**.

Instead of writing blockchain-specific code for Ethereum, Solana, Sui, Avalanche, or others — Chainlang aims to let developers **write once, and deploy across multiple chains**.

---

## 🧠 Vision

The blockchain world is fragmented.

Smart contract developers must learn multiple languages, tools, and frameworks just to build for different networks. Chainlang proposes a unified, high-level language that abstracts chain-specific complexities while preserving performance and security.

---

## 🔍 Goal

To design a language that compiles to multiple blockchain targets, including:

- Ethereum (via Solidity)
- Solana (via Rust)
- Sui (via Move)
- Cosmos (via Wasm)
- More in the future

---

## 📦 Current Status

Chainlang is in early ideation and design phase.  
This repository exists to **share the vision** and begin exploring architecture, syntax, and community interest.

No compiler, syntax, or tooling is ready yet.
